# vexflowPiano

Fork the repository and point your browser to the home.html file locally, and you'll see two bars of vexflow rendered.

The bars.js file makes the vexflow bar and line objects that will later be rendered to the canvas in the rendering file.

The notes.js function includes the functions for creating a "voice" for a single measure and then formatting it (adding it) to a relevant bar.

Lastly, there's a short, rudimentary function that would be more useful for "quick" adding of notes to the score by simply listing intervals. It doesn't deal with rhythms though.
